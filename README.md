# Postman Learning Center

Postman is the collaboration platform for API development. And the [Postman Learning Center](https://learning.getpostman.com/) has the resources you need to ramp up quickly and extend your skills with Postman.

## Contribution guidelines

We would love for you to contribute to the Learning Center! To contribute to this project, please read:

* The [Code of Conduct](https://community.getpostman.com/t/postman-code-of-conduct/5)
* The [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* The [Documentation Style Guide](DOCS_STYLE_GUIDE.md)

**NOTE:** We have added a new Markdown linter with GitHub Actions. When making a pull request, it will run against this linter. Your changed files are required to pass linting before they will be merged. More information on this can be found in the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Build the Learning Center locally

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-docs.git
   $ cd postman-docs
   $ npm install
   $ npm install -g gatsby-cli
   $ npm run dev
```

**NOTE:** this site was build with node v12.11.0. We recommend installing and using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and setting your node version to v12.11.0.

## Project Structure

The built site will only host the most up-to-date docs. All legacy documentation is stored in github and excluded from build.

### To update the docs

* Posts are maintained under the `/src/pages/docs` folder.

* The folder structure of /docs is the URL structure for posts. For example, `/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/sessions.md` is mapped to URL `https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/sessions/`.

* Links in the docs should be relative. Example:

```
   [Newman](/docs/postman/collection_runs/command_line_integration_with_newman/)
```
