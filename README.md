# Postman Learning Center

Postman is the collaboration platform for API development. And the [Postman Learning Center](https://learning.postman.com/) has the resources you need to ramp up quickly and extend your skills with Postman. Postman allows you to write API test cases in any format of your choice (JSON/XML/many more) and run them to verify and validate your API. Moreover, Postman provides collections which can improve a developer's workflow. Postman is available for several platforms including windows and Mac OS X. For more information visit [getpostman](getpostman.com).

## Project Structure

The built site will only host the most up-to-date docs. All legacy documentation is stored in github and excluded from build.

### To update the docs

* Posts are maintained under the `/src/pages/docs` folder.

* The folder structure of /docs is the URL structure for posts. For example, `/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables.md` is mapped to URL `https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables/`.

* Links in the docs should be relative. Example:

```
   [Newman](/docs/postman/collection-runs/command-line-integration-with-newman/)
```
