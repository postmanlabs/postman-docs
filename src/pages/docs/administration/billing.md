## Billing dashboard

The Postman [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) provides access to account management.

### Viewing account history

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Account History**. This page allows you to view your team's historical billing activity, as well as the date and time of each action.

[![account history](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/account-history.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/account-history.jpg)

Items such as updates to your Postman subscription, card changes, payments, and charges are all listed in chronological order.  

### Viewing past invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Invoices**. To get a copy of an invoice, hover over its listing and select **Get Invoice**.

[![invoices](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invoices.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invoices.jpg)

To add or edit the information on an invoice, see [adding custom information to invoices](#adding-custom-information-to-invoices).

### Managing overages

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Overages**. Check or uncheck the box to enable or disable monitoring overages for your team.

[![monitoring overages](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/monitoring-overages.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/monitoring-overages.jpg)

> If your API development pipeline is dependent on Postman monitoring, disabling overages may cause unintended consequences. To avoid this as well as potentially fluctuating pay-as-you-go charges, check out [pre-paid monitoring blocks](/docs/postman/monitors/intro-monitors/#pricing).

## Payments

Postman offers various payment options dependent on your plan type.

### Managing cards

In order to add, remove, or set a default card, select **Payment Methods** in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

To add, click **Add A New Card**.

To remove, hover over the card in question and select the trash can icon.

To set a card as default, hover over the card and **Set as Default**.

### Adding custom information to invoices

To add or edit the information on an invoice, navigate to your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) and select **Invoices** > **Edit Invoice Details** > **Billing Details**.

Add or update your billing email, company name, address, and (if applicable) VAT ID, then **Save Changes**. All future [invoices](https://go.postman.co/billing/invoices) will have the updated copy. To modify an existing invoice, [submit a request](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us).

[![billing details](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-details.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-details.jpg)

### Failed payments

If you have a card on file, Postman will automatically attempt 3 times to charge it. If this is unsuccessful, team members with billing privileges will be notified via email.

[![failed payment email](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/failed-payment-email.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/failed-payment-email.jpg)

If payment is unsuccessful, Postman offers a grace period of 10 days to avoid service disruption. For invoice-based teams, this means 10 days following the due date listed on the invoice.

> All team members are notified in the event of non-payment and subsequent service deactivation in the Postman app.

## Team and plan changes

You can change your team's plan and billing cycle in the [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview). To upgrade to Postman Business or Enterprise, [email the team](mailto:thepostmanteam@postman.com).

### Changing your plan

To change your plan, navigate to your [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview), then click **...** > **Change Plan**. Select your desired plan from the drop-down and choose **Annual** or **Monthly** for your billing cycle. Adjust your team size, then **Proceed** to confirm changes.

[![change plan](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-new.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-new.jpg)

### Setting instructions for next billing cycle

You can set instructions to determine what will happen at the end of your current billing cycle. To do so, navigate to your [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview), then click **...** > **Set instructions for next billing cycle**.

You can view your current plan and opt to **Edit Standing Instructions**. Select your desired option from the drop-down, then click **Proceed** and confirm your changes.

[![set instructions next cycle](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/set-billing-instructions.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/set-billing-instructions.jpg)

> You can change your standing instructions at any time before the end of your current billing cycle.

### Changing billing cycle

Monthly teams can switch to an annual plan at any time by navigating to your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and selecting **...** > **Change Plan**.

[![change plan](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-new.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-new.jpg)

> Annual teams can switch to a monthly plan at the end of the current billing cycle.Â The number of days left in your current billing cycle appears under **Upcoming Invoice**.

### Purchasing monitoring blocks

The availability of monitoring calls depends on your [Postman plan level](https://www.postman.com/pricing), with a portion allocated at no extra charge on all paid plans. Unless monitoring overages are [disabled](#managing-overages), you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

To purchase monitoring blocks, visit your [monitoring usage details](http://go.postman.co/usage/monitors) and select **Set monitoring block count**.
