Yes. New customers can send an email to sales@postman.com to get started.

For existing customers, pending payments are listed at https://app.getpostman.com/pay/billing. These can be paid online, or via check/wire-transfer. Offline payment instructions are on the invoice that's sent to the registered billing email address as a PDF file.
