When you create an account with Postman, it's mandatory to provide the email id, username and password. Postman needs each user to have a unique username.

If you face an error stating _**'An account with this username already exists'**_, try providing the same email as username during signup or try using different permutations of a unique name as username. You won't be able to get a certain username if the username you requested exists in our database.
