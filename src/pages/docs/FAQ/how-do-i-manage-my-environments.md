In the upper right corner of your Postman app, there's a settings icon (small cog) that once clicked will allow you to select "[Manage Environments](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments)". There you'll be able to create, share, duplicate, export, and delete environments.
