If you removed a collection from a workspace, and are not sure where to find it, here's what you can do to recover it:

1. If you're on Postman Pro / Enterprise, and the collection was shared, you can head to "[https://go.postman.co/team/elements?type=collection](https://go.postman.co/team/elements?type=collection)" on your team domain. Here, you'll see all shared collections, and you'll be able to ""Share"" them to the correct workspace.
2. If the collection was not shared, head to "[https://go.postman.co/me/collections](https://go.postman.co/me/collections)". Here, you'll see all your private collections, and you'll be able to ""Share"" them to the correct workspace.
