When you create an account with Postman, your email address gets added to our mailing list since we don't want our community to miss out on the latest features, tutorials and community content.

If you do not wish to receive any newsletters from our end you can use the unsubscribe link in the email to stop receiving them, or reach out to us at help@postman.com.
