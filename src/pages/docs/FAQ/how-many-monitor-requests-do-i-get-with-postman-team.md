Postman Team users get 10,000 requests per month for their team, with the option of buying a block of 50,000 prepaid requests for $20 per month. If you go over your 10,000 requests (without buying the larger block), we will charge $0.75 for every 1000 requests over the limit. To learn more about monitoring pricing, please review the relevant documentation [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/monitors/intro-monitors/#pricing).
