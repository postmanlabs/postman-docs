### Postman window is blank

**Issue**
---------

For Windows computers with certain GPUs, Postman may display a **blank/black window** when opened, and elements in the app may not be rendering correctly or at all.

This issue may be related to a known issue where Postman doesnâ€™t launch with certain GPUs. A workaround for this issue involves [disabling your GPU](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/4594#issuecomment-391601621). Disabling GPU rendering for Postman generally allows the app to run successfully. To do so, you'll need to add a Windows environment variable: `POSTMAN_DISABLE_GPU`, with the value: `true`

**Instructions:**

1\. Open:  `Advanced system settings`
