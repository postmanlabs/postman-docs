Starting October 2015, Jetpacks has been included for free in all installations of Postman. If you want any team member to use Jetpacks' features, all they need to do is install the app.

Once you start the [free 7-day trial](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard) or [upgrade to Pro](https://app.getpostman.com/pay/billing), you'll be able to add users to your team.
