At this point, Postman offers limited support for 2FA on Google accounts. If you're unable to complete the 2FA login process in the Postman app, your best bet would be to head to the link [Trouble signing in](https://identity.getpostman.com/trouble-signing-in) and request a new password. If you don't see any password reset emails from us even in Spam/ Junk folders, whitelist noreply@notifications.getpostman.com in your email client, or domain policy if necessary.

Once your password is reset, you can use your email + password combination to login through the app.
