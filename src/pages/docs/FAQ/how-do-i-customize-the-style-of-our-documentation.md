When publishing a collection, the Postman Documenter allows you to customize color choices, as well as add in your company logo and custom URL. To do so, click the "Styling" Tab while publishing your collection docs.

If you would like to make changes to styling after publishing your docs, make sure you are signed into the Postman Dashboard and navigate to your docs via the generated URL. Click the green "Published" button and then "Edit public documentation > Edit Settings" to return to the original form where to customize styling and then "Update" your docs.
