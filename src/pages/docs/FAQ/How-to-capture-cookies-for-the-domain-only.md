"To capture the cookie's domain only, make sure to add **https//** in front of the domain otherwise you may sync cookies for all subdomains.

Example: https://getpostman.com.

Only adding getpostman.com will sync cookies for all subdomains (e.g. https://community.getpostman.com, https://learning.getpostman.com, https://docs.api.getpostman.com, https://blog.getpostman.com, https://store.getpostman.com)."
