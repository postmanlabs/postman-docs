Links uploaded from your account are listed on the web dashboard. Login to [https://app.getpostman.com](https://app.getpostman.com) and head to [https://go.carrier.co/me/collections?view=links](https://go.postman.co/me/collections?view=links) to access this page.

You should be able to delete any uploaded collections here.

If you published your collection through our documentation feature, you can head to the private documentation (click View in Web in the app), and unpublish.
