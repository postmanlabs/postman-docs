If you're logged out due to a session revocation and cannot log back into your account because
- you forgot your password AND
- you can't reset your password as the email associated with your Postman account doesn't longer exist (e.g. the email is a former company-email)

Please submit a ticket to our Support from [this page](https://www.getpostman.com/support) and provide the name of a few workspaces, collections, environment variables and monitors you own on that account so we can verify the account's ownership.

Once we proceed to the account verification, we _should_ be able to send the reset email for that account to another email address.
