If you're using the Postman Chrome app:

1. We strongly suggest you move to the native apps ([https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)) due to the deprecation of our official chrome extension for (OSX / Windows / Linux) and the native apps support a lot more features.
2. Before reinstalling, head to [chrome://indexeddb-internals/](chrome://indexeddb-internals/) and search for ""fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop"". There will be two folders listed - backup the contents of these folders.
3. Reinstall (navigate to this [link](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) and reinstall the latest version) and move the backup to its original location.
