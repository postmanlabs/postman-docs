If you receive billing notifications and emails about your Postman team, you're the designated billing contact for your team. However, in order to make any billing related changes like upgrading the plan or canceling a subscription, you'll need to be a member of the team (with the billing role enabled). A member with only the Billing role will not take up paid slots.

Contact the team's administrative user to invite you to the team.
