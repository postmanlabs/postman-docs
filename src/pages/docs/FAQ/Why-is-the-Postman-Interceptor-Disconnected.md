"By default, the postman Interceptor for cookies will be disconnected. Toggling the capture cookies setting won’t affect the connection status.

The status is only determined by

*   whether Chrome is open with the Interceptor extension installed

*   whether the bridge has been installed.


You need to make sure the following prerequisites are fulfilled to have the interceptor working as expected.

1\. Install the postman interceptor bridge  
2\. Update the interceptor extension for chrome to 0.2.26  
3\. Restart the Chrome browser.  

Please refer to the below documentation for detailed instructions:​
