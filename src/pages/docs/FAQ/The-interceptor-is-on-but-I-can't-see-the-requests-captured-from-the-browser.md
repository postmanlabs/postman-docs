Currently, the native app’s interceptor feature **enables you to capture cookies only and doesn’t have the ability to capture browser requests.** A workaround for capturing HTTP requests, for now, would be to use [the Postman Proxy feature.](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/capturing_http_requests "https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/capturing_http_requests")
