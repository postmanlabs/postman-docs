Unfortunately, we have little visibility over the reason for payments being declined. You can try using the same card after a while, or try another card.

If an automatic payment attempt (to renew your monthly/annual plan) fails, we'll send an invoice to the registered billing email ID. Unpaid invoices will also be visible on the [billing page](https://app.getpostman.com/pay/billing).

Payment instructions can be found in the invoice itself.

Contact us at sales@postman.com for more information.
