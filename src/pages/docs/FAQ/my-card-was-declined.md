Unfortunately, we have little visibility over the reason for payments being declined. You can try using the same card after a little while, or try another card. You can also contact your credit card provider for more information.

If you are purchasing the Enterprise plan, you can pay via ACH, Wire Transfer or Check.

Contact us at sales@postman.com for more information.
