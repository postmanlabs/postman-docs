Newman is a powerful command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line. Newman maintains feature parity with Postman and allows you to run collections the same way they are executed inside the collection runner in Postman.

Newman resides on both [Github](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) and at the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.org/package/newman).
