To add a logo to your docs, visit the [Postman Dashboard Team section](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams). Click the "Team Settings" gear icon located on the left pane and then edit/upload your logo under Logo section and "Save changes".

This should reflect on your published documentation soon. If not, you can try force-refreshing the page or open the documentation in incognito mode.

For further questions please review our relevant documentation [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/creating_documentation).
