Postman does not track any content of your requests/responses.

We only track the number of requests made, number of headers sent etc to identify what features of the app are being used. Even this information is anonymous - any Postman user adding a header will cause the same tracking information to be sent.

You can disable all tracking by setting 'Send anonymous usage data to Postman' to No in the settings window.
