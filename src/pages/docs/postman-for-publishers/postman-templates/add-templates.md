You can share your documentation for any [collection](/docs/postman/collections/intro-to-collections/) you publish by adding it to the Postman Templates. Adding your templates makes them available to the Postman community through the app via __New__ &gt; __Templates__ and [on the web](https://explore.postman.com/templates).

Your template listing provides access to the documentation for your API collection, and the __Run in Postman__ button, which allows anyone to import the collection directly into the Postman app. Community members can browse and search for templates to learn, and automate tasks relevant to a wide variety of use cases. People can also access your Postman profile via your template listings.

By publishing your collection docs to the Postman templates, you're sharing both human-readable and executable data that helps people get started using APIs. Your docs can outline how to use a single endpoint as well as how to integrate with an API as a whole, helping community members learn API skills and discover available services.

> If you're publishing documentation from a team API, you can [add it to the API Network](/docs/postman-for-publishers/api-network/add-api-network/) as part of your team listing.
>
> When you add to the Postman templates, your listing will also be discoverable via your profile. You can [set your profile up before](#setting-up-your-profile) or during publication, or Postman will generate a profile that you can optionally edit later.

## Adding your templates

To add to the shared Postman templates, you first need to [document and publish a collection](/docs/postman/api-documentation/documenting-your-api/). You can share your collection to the Postman templates during the docs [publishing process](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-your-docs/), or later. During publication, enable __Collection discovery__ and select __Add to Postman Templates__.

If your collection documentation is already published, you can make it discoverable by editing the published docs.

> You can access your published docs from the Postman app (select the collection and click __View in web__), or from the web dashboard (navigate to __Workspace__ &gt; __Collections__ and click the published collection title).

Click __Allow Collection Discovery__ to set up your docs for sharing.

![Allow Discovery](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/allow-discovery.jpg)

Select __Add to Postman Templates__.

### Providing template detail

Enter display details for your template listing, including __Template Name__, __Summary__, and __Description__. Your description will be automatically pulled from any [description you have added to your collection already](/docs/postman/api-documentation/authoring-your-documentation/), and should include the information potential users will need to know whether to try the template or not.

![Template Detail](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-publish-detail.jpg)

Select any relevant categories for your templateâ€”users will be able to browse using categories in both the Postman app and [on the web](https://explore.postman.com).

![Template Tags](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-tags.jpg)

### Setting up your profile

You can choose to publish your templates under your personal Postman profile, or from a team profile.

![Publish As](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/publish-as.jpg)

> Templates published from a team will also appear in the API Network listing _Templates_ tab for the team.

To set up your profile, click __Public Profile Settings__ or navigate to [your settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/public) in the web dashboard. Click __Enable Public Profile__ to allow your templates to be published.

![Enable Profile](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/enable-personal-profile.jpg)

You can customize your profile URL and name, and add a description people will see alongside your templates. You can also set a profile photo from your [account settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me).

> Customizing your profile URL will change your username, and that change will be reflected across all of your Postman elements, such as collections and documentation. You will also sign in to Postman with the new username.

![Personal Profile Settings](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/personal-profile-settings.jpg)

> If you choose to disable your profile, you won't be able to publish any new templates, and any previously published will be unpublished.

## Publishing your template

When your publish settings are complete, click __Publish Collection__. You will see a confirmation of your template listing and public profile.

![Templates Published](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/templates-published.jpg)

Your templates will be discoverable from inside the Postman app using __New__ &gt; __Templates__ and [on the web](https://explore.postman.com/templates).

Your template listing will show the description and publisher details, plus links to the documentation and the __Run in Postman__ button people can use to import the collection and try the requests in the Postman app.

![API Listing](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-listing-template.jpg)

Your profile listing will be available both in the Postman app, and on the web, listing all of your published templates.
