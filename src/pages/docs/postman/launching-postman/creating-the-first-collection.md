Postman Collections are a group of saved requests you can organize into folders.

Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. However, as your Postman usage scales, it can be time consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of combing through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

Let's review how to [send a basic request](/docs/postman/launching-postman/sending-the-first-request/) and create a new collection.

## Creating your first collection

Enter a request in the request builder and click the **Save** button to open the **SAVE REQUEST** modal.

[![request builder](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/SaveRequest1.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/SaveRequest1.png)

* As an optional step, enter a new request name. Otherwise, the default name will be the request URL.
* As an optional step, enter a request description in plain text or using [Markdown](/docs/postman/collections/using-markdown-for-descriptions/).

Save this request to an existing collection, or create a new collection by entering a collection name, and then click the **Save** button.

Congratulations! You can see all of your collections under the **Collections** tab of the sidebar on the left, as illustrated in the screen below:
