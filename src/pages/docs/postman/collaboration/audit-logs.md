Audit logs list important team events. An admin can review audit logs to determine:

* When users were added to the team.
* When users received an invitation to a team.
* Which user performed a specific action.

Audit logs currently include events for team management, billing, and security. In the future, logs will indicate events for publishing documentation, creating API keys, and creating monitors.

## Using audit logs

In your [workspace](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard), click the Settings icon, and select "Audit logs".
