You can share the run results for a collection, by [exporting them from the Collection Runner](#exporting-collection-runs) so that other people can [import them into Postman](#importing-a-run).

## Exporting collection runs

To export a collection run, click __Runner__ and find the run you want to export in the __Recent Runs__ list. You will see the __Export run__ icon appear on hoverâ€”click it to download the run.

You also can select a collection run from the __Recent Runs__ list and download it from there by clicking **Export Results** at the top.
