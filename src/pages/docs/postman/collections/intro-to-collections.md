## What is a Postman Collection?

A Postman Collection lets you group individual requests together. You can organize these requests into folders.

## Why create collections?

Here are several reasons why you should create collections.

### Organization

You can group together requests into folders and collections, so that you don't have to search through your history repeatedly.

### Documentation

You can add a name and descriptions to requests, folders, and collections. In Postman, you can use the collection browser to view the documentation.

### Test suites

You can attach test scripts to requests and build integration test suites.

### Conditional workflows

You can use scripts to pass data between API requests and build workflows that mirror your actual API use case.
