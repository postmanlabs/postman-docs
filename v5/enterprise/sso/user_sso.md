Once a team admin has enabled single sign on (**SSO**) for Postman, user will log into Postman using configured Identity provider. There are two ways of doing this.

1.  User can ask team admin for the **Login URL** which is generated at the time of configuring the **SSO**. The **Login URL** will automatically redirect user to the configured Identity Provider.

2.  User can use **Sign in to Enterprise** button/hyperlink from Postman Web/ Postman App.  

    *  In Postman App, use the hyperlink at the top right while signing in. On clicking it, a new window will be opened within the app.

    *  In this step, enter **Team Domain** to continue.

    *  Next, user will be redirected to the configured Identity Provider. Here, for example the **G-Suite** Login screen.
