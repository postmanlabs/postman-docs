BigPanda is an IT systems management platform that aggregates and correlates IT alerts to create high-level IT incidents. It allows different services to be connected to have a single place where all the alerts can be directed to.

**How your alerts appear in BigPanda**

BigPanda gives you real-time alerting based on the results of your Postman Monitors. If there was a failed test or if an error occurred during the run, an alert would be created on BigPanda which would then alert the user.
