Postman enables you to change your Pro (Annual) or Pro (Monthly) plan.

To change your plan, go to the [Billing Overview](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) page. You will see different actions for changing your plan, depending on whether you’re on the Pro (Annual) or Pro (Monthly) plan.

### Pro (Monthly)

If you’re on the annual subscription of Postman Pro, you can:

* Change the team size or the billing cycle to annual.
* Cancel your subscription.

### Changing your plan

Click the **Change Plan** button.

You can change the billing cycle of your subscription and the size of your Pro team. Your team size cannot be less than the number of users already in your Pro team.

**Note**: To reduce the size of your team, go to the Dashboard and click the “Team “dropdown menu. Then select the **View Team** button to remove users from the team.

Click the **Proceed** button to confirm the details and proceed to payment. 

If you’ve opted to switch to an annual subscription, your saved credit card is charged the entire amount for the new plan immediately. 

If you’ve increased your team size, your next invoice includes the charge for new users for the remainder of the month (users added * number of days remaining till billing date /30 * cost of plan), with the charge for your new team size. 

If you’ve decreased your team size, your next invoice reflects the new team size.

### Canceling your plan

Click the ellipsis (...) next to the **Add User Slots** button, and then select “Cancel Plan”.

In the Cancel Plan page, indicate why you want to cancel. Then click the **Cancel Current Plan** button, or even better, click the **I’ve changed my mind** button.

### Pro (Annual)

If you’re on the annual Postman Pro subscription, you can:

* Increase the size of your team. In the Pro (Annual) plan you cannot immediately decrease the size of your team. To reduce your team size for the next payment, go to “Setting instructions for your next billing cycle”. 
* Indicate any changes you want to your plan when the existing billing cycle is over.
* Cancel your subscription immediately.
