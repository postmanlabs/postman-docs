To validate if a JSON file is in the correct collections format, you can use our schema files for collections.

The schema file is located at [https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v1/][0].

The associated documentation can be found at [https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v1/docs/][1].

Everything is neatly stored on GitHub [https://github.com/postmanlabs/schemas][2].

To see an example of data validation using our schema and [is-my-json-valid][3] (a validator), check out [this blog post][4].
