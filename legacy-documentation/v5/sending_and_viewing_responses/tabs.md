A lot of users might want to keep multiple requests open at the same time. The Tabs feature lets you do this. Any request you send (and its response) are local to the tab it's in, and you can switch to other tabs without losing the first response.

Use `Cmd + Shift + { , }` (`Ctrl` for windows) to cycle through open tabs.

When you click on a saved request in the collection sidebar, the request will open in the tab you have open. However, if the request that's open in the current tab is dirty (orange dot in the tab header), the new request will open in a new tab.

You can also use `Cmd+Shift+Click` (or `Ctrl+Shift+Click`) to force-open the request in a new tab.
