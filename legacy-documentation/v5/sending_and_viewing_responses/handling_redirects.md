By default, Postman will follow the Location header in all 301/302 responses automatically. To disable this behavior, you can set the **Automatically follow redirects** setting to No.

This prevents requests that return a 300-series response to be automatically redirected. If you are on the Chrome app, you'll have to install the Interceptor for this feature to work.
