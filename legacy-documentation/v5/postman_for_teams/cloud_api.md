The Postman API allows you to programmatically access data stored in Postman Pro with ease.

Click the Run in Postman button below to get started with the API. You can then use the Postman App to send requests.

### General overview

The Postman API will only respond to secured communication done over HTTPS. HTTP requests will be sent a `301` redirect to corresponding HTTPS resources.

* Response to every request is sent in [JSON format][0].
* The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the \`GET\` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman Pro, and \`POST\` implies you want to save something new to Postman Pro. Currently, the APIs available **only support GET methods**. The rest of the methods are coming soon.
* The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP status codes][1] for all requests. Within the Postman App, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A \`200 OK\` indicates all went well, while \`4XX\` or \`5XX\` response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively.

### Authentication

An API Key tells our servers that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman Pro is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you. 
> 
> If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the [Postman Integrations Dashboard][2].

An API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Postman API, in a header called `X-Api-Key`. If you are unable to set headers for a request, you can add your API Key in the `apikey` query parameter.

For ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable][3] called \`postman\_api\_key\` and this Collection\](https://www.postman.com/docs/collections) will automatically use it to make API calls.

If an API Key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorised` response code and the following JSON response:

    
    {
      "error": { 
        "name": "AuthenticationError",
        "message": "API Key missing. Every request requires an API Key to be sent."
      }
    }
    

### API Access Rate Limits

API access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption:
HeaderDescription
`X-RateLimit-Limit`The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute.

`X-RateLimit-Remaining`The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.

`X-RateLimit-Reset`The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.

  
Once you hit the rate limit, you will receive a response similar to the following JSON, with a status code of `429 Too Many Requests`:

    
    {
      "error": {
        "name": "rateLimitError",
        "message": "Rate Limit exceeded. Please retry at 1465452702843"
      }
    }
    

  
Every user is permitted to create upto 10 keys. To increase this limit, please create a ticket via our [support center][4].

### Getting Help

For help regarding accessing the Postman API, feel free to discuss it in the `#cloudapi` channel of our [Slack Community][5] ([get invite][6]). You can also drop in a line at [help@postman.com](mailto:help@postman.com).
In the event you receive a `503` response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and would usually be operational within the next 5 minutes. If the outage persists, or your receive any other form of `5XX` error, kindly let us know.
