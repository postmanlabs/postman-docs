If you have Postman's Chrome app installed, it'll be accessible via `chrome://apps` in your browser.

You can also start Postman through the Chrome App Launcher app. The Chrome App Launcher resides in your dock or taskbar.
You can also keep a persistent icon for Postman that can bypass Chrome altogether.
