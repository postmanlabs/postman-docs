### Can I use Postman for free?

Yes, you can use Postman for free. On the free plan, you cannot share or auto sync collections with team members, but you have full access to the testing suite, command-line tools, and the Run in Postman button. You also have the option to try out Postman Pro for free for 30 days with your team.

### We need to add someone to our team. How will that be billed?

The cost for your new team member's account will be prorated for the remainder of the current billing period. We'll track this for you, and add it to your bill at the end of the month.

As an example, suppose your team is on the Pro plan, which costs $6.10 per user per month when billed monthly. You add a new team member 10 days into your billing period and there are 20 remaining days in the month. The per-day cost for each user is $6.10 / 30, so the additional cost for that month will be $4.07 ($6.10 / 30 days \* 20 days).

### We disabled the account of one of our team members. How does that affect our subscription?

When you delete a user from the team, you get an extra invite. You can add another person or leave the invite pending. Your team size, and hence your monthly bill, stays the same.

### Our team has several accounts which are not being actively used, but which we don't want to disable. Do we still have to pay for them?

Unfortunately for now, yes. Your bill will reflect total active users and invites left.

### My team has credits: how do we use them?

Once your team signs up for a subscription plan, we'll draw against your credit balance until it runs out. Only then will we start charging your subscription to your credit card.

### Our credit card expired or was canceled. What do I do?

Anyone on your team who is an Admin can add a new card and change the default card.

### My team wants to cancel its subscription. How do we do that? Can we get a refund?

If you are not 100% satisfied with Pro, we will fully refund the cost of your order within 30 days from the purchase date. You can also cancel your subscription at any time and you won't be charged for the following payment period. We do not offer prorated canceling currently.

### What happens to our team's data when we downgrade from a paid plan to the free version?

We won't delete any of your data or collections. Only the creators will have access to the collections previously shared in the team library.

### We can't pay by credit card. Can you invoice my company?

We can invoice large teams who subscribe to a yearly plan. Contact us at [help@postman.com][0] to arrange this. All monthly plans must be paid by credit card.

### I'm not the billing contact for our company. Can I have billing statements automatically sent to someone else?

You can set up a billing contact email address when you get started on Pro. If you have already gotten started and not put that in, you can email us at [help@postman.com][0].

### My accounting department requires some additional information on invoices. How can I customize our invoice and billing statements?

Message us at [help@postman.com][0] and we'll do our best to help.

### I referred a new team. Can I get credit?

We're working out a referrals program. Until then, send us an email with the team admin of the new team cc-ed and your mailing address. We'll send you some t-shirts and stickers.

### My team is a nonprofit organization. Is there special Postman pricing available for nonprofits or charitable organizations?

Nothing yet. But message us at [help@postman.com][0] and we'll see what we can do!

### My team is an education institution or student group. Is there special Postman pricing available for my organization?

Nothing yet. But we plan to offer something for qualified nonprofit or accredited K-12 or higher education institutions, or student groups associated with those institutions on annual plans. Message us at [help@postman.com][0] and we'll see what we can do!
