When you create a new Workspace, you must determine whether it is a personal or team Workspace.

Postman account users can create an unlimited number of personal Workspaces. Users who don't have a Postman account can have only one personal Workspace. Postman Pro and Enterprise teams have one default team Workspace and can create an unlimited number of Workspaces.

### How to create a new Workspace

Click any Workspace that displays in the header bar. For example, in the image below, you'd click "My Workspace". Click "Personal" or "Team" and then click "Create New".

**Personal**

If you select "Personal", enter the name and description of the Workspace. If you decide instead to create a team Workspace, select "Team" in the Type menu. Click the **Create Workspace** button to see or add existing collections, or [create a collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections/).

Add the email addresses of existing users you want to invite to this team Workspace. Click the **Create Workspace** button to see or add existing collections, or [create a collection](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections/).
