From the **Collections** tab in the sidebar:

##### **Navigate through collections**

Click on a collection to show or hide the requests that comprise the collection. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the collections.

##### **Edit and view collection details**

Expand the right angle bracket (**>**) to show the details view for the collection. Collapse the left angle bracket (**<**) to hide the details view. You can add metadata like name and description so that all the information a developer needs to use your API is available easily.

### Other collection features

##### **Reorder requests**

Within a collection or folder, you can reorder requests using drag and drop. You can also reorder folders within a collection using drag and drop. 

##### **Save responses** 

Requests can also store [sample responses](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/responses/) when saved in a collection.

##### **Use examples** 

With [examples](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/examples/), you can mock raw responses and save them to a collection. Then, you’ll be able to generate a mock endpoint for each of them using Postman’s [mock service](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/mock_servers/intro_to_mock_servers/). 

##### **Add scripts**

Requests stored inside a collection can contain [scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/scripts/intro_to_scripts/) to add dynamic behavior to the collection.

### Adding folders

Folders are a way to organize your API endpoints within a collection into intuitive and logical groups to mirror your workflow. Next to the collection to which you want to add a folder, click on the ellipsis (...) and select "Add Folder".

[![add folder from dropdown](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/WS-addFolderDropdown.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/WS-addFolderDropdown.png)

Add a name and description to the folder. Folders are initially ordered alphabetically by name, and the folder name and description will be reflected in your API documentation.

[![add folder modal](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/59183817.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/59183817.png)

You can add deeper levels of nesting for folders. Drag and drop the folders to reorder them to create the ultimate customized folder structure.
