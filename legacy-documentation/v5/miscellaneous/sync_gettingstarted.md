You can now use the powerful synchronization and collaboration features that Postman has to offer. Creating a Postman team is the first step towards Collaborative API development. As part of the beta, you are entitled to create a team of up to 20 users. Jetpacks comes bundled for free for your entire team.

#### For the team admin:

1. If you've received an invite to sync, you'll be able to create a new team by filling the sync beta form
2. After the team has been provisioned, go to the teams page to invite users to your team.

#### For the team members:

5. You can create new collections or even import your existing collections and settings from your existing Postman packaged app, as outlined in the migration documentation

#### Collaboration:

Postman is designed to work well for you, both independently and in a team. Only the collections you choose to share and collaborate on, are visible to your team. Other collections are visible only to you. This section describes how you can accomplish this.

##### Share:

1. Click on the Share Collection next to the Collection
