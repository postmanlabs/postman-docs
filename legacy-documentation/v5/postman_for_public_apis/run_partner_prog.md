We will launch the Run in Postman button in mid-March. We are currently accepting requests to partner on the launch.

Partnering gets you the following,

1. We will release an in-app message to our 2.5 Million users about the button launch with a link to the list of all partners. You will be listed here with a link to your documentation with the button. This will encourage interested devs to try your API out right away.
2. 
Dedicated tweet with a link to the documentation with the button.
3. 
Mention in a blog post with a list of all the partners with a link to your documentation and a description.
4. 
In some cases, your product, users, or some other chutzpah might warrant a dedicated blog post. Please let us know what that might be if you are interested.

What you need to do to partner with us,

1. Implement the Run in Postman button on any of your external API documentation whether it is on a webpage or a repo readme.
2. 
Reach out to us with your interest - [help@postman.com][0].
3. 
Tweet about the button with a link to your documentation on launch day.
4. 
Optional - Blog about your experience with the run button. We will definitely be cross-posting this one.
