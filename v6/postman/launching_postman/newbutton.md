When you click the **New** button, the **Create New** tab appears as the default view. 

In addition to the **Create New** tab, there are two other tabs: "Templates" and "API Network". For more information about these tabs, see the [Templates and API Network sections](/docs/v6/postman/launching_postman/newbutton#templates).

### Create New  

You can create a new *Request, Collection, Environment, API Documentation, Mock Server, and Monitor* using the **New** button. Alternatively, you can also directly create these when you click the down arrow at the right side of the **New** button, as illustrated below:

[![new_button2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/CreateNew_DropDown.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/CreateNew_DropDown.png)

In **BUILDING BLOCKS**, create a new request, collection, or environment.

In **ADVANCED**, create new documentation, a mock server, or a monitor.

At the bottom of this window, you can select “Show this window at launch” to indicate whether you want the **Create New** tab to display each time you open Postman.

[![new_button](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-new-button-menu-blk.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-new-button-menu-blk.png)

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.
2. In the **Create New** tab, click "Request".
3. Save the request to an existing collection, or create a new one.

After you save the request to a collection, you can add the URL, method, headers, and body to the request in the builder.

### Create documentation

Under **ADVANCED**, you can create [public or private documentation](/docs/postman/v6/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation) and share it in a web page. Postman generates browser-based documentation for your collections, that can be updated automatically in real-time. 

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.

### Create a mock server

A [mock server](/docs/postman/v6/mock_servers/setting_up_mock) simulates each endpoint in a Postman Collection. You can mock a request and response in Postman before you send the actual request or set up a single endpoint to return the response. 

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.
1. In the **Create New** tab, click “Mock Server”.
1. Select if you want to mock a new API or an existing or team collection. If you create a new API to mock, you must select a request method and enter the request path, response code, and response body. If you use an existing or team collection to mock, you must select a collection from a list of existing or team collections. 
[![config mock](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-mock-config-1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-mock-config-1.png) 
1. After you select or create the request you want to mock, click the **Next** button. In the **Configure mock server** tab, you must:
* Enter the name of the mock
* Select an environment (optional).
* Indicate if you want to make this mock server private
**Note**: The number of calls made to mock servers might be limited by your Postman account. Check your [usage limits](https://go.postman.co/usage).

1. Click the **Create** button.

In the **Next steps** tab, see a list of suggested next steps to get the most out of your mock server.

### Templates

Under the **Templates** tab, there are a variety of collection templates available to help you check links, track GitHub issues, verify non-MFA access to AWS accounts, monitor the status of URLs, check DNS records, use Postman Echo to test your REST client and make sample API calls, monitor AWS ElasticBeanstalk environments, and more. 

You can view all the templates, or select to view them in the "Developer" or "DevOps" category.

[![templates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-templates-tab-1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-templates-tab-1.png)

To import a template:

1. Click on the template you want. In this example we're using the "Link Checker" template.
**Note**: Each template has a description that lists the values required to run the template. In this example, the Link Checker template requires a `start_url` and a `root_url`.
[![linkCheckertemplates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-linkchecker-template-1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-linkchecker-template-1.png)
1. Click the **Use this template** button to summon the **Customization options** screen. This screen lists what Postman will create for you with this template and some configuration options available to you. Postman saves the values you enter as environment variables. Make sure you fill all the fields as these values might be crucial for the template to work properly.
1. To configure your monitor, select how often you want the monitor to run and enter the URL you want to monitor in "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS" section.
1. Click the **Create** button. The **Success!** screen displays what Postman created for you and suggests next steps to consider to get the most out of the template.
1. Click the **Okay** button to exit the screen.

### API Network

The [Postman API Network](https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/) provides the most authentic and actionable directory of public APIs available. Every API listed in this network includes a complete Postman collection, created by the API's publisher. Postman specifically designed the API list to onboard developers quickly and effectively.

From the Postman app, click the orange **New** button and select the **API Network** tab. Search for an API, or browse by a particular category. Postman groups the APIs by category such as Marketing, Financial Services, E-commerce, and so on. You can filter by category to find an API, or directly search for the name of the API. After you select an API from the list, you can import it into the Postman app.

[![API_network](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/api-network-static-categories.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/api-network-static-categories.png)

When you find the API that you’re looking for, click the Run in Postman button to import the collection into Postman.

[![search for api in api network](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/api-network-new-button.gif)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/api-network-new-button.gif)

Once the collection is imported into Postman, you can see the collection in the sidebar and begin executing the requests.

[![imported collection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/api-network-nice-pay.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/api-network-nice-pay.png)

If you're an API publisher, you can share your API documentation with your users and the rest of the Postman community by [publishing your documentation to the Postman API Network]().
