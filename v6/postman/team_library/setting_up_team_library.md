 **NOTE**: **Team Library is only available for versions 5.0 and below.**

Postman Pro and Enterprise users can use the Team Library to enhance collaboration among teammates. This feature enhances collaboration among teammates in several ways.

* **Share collections**
  
  You can [share collections](/docs/v6/postman/team_library/sharing#sharing-collections) with your team. Collections contain groups of API requests you can organize, add descriptions, attach test scripts, and build conditional workflows.
* **Share environments**
  
  Teams can use [environments](/docs/v6/postman/api_documentation/environments_and_environment_templates) to create and [share a snapshot of a local environment](/docs/v6/postman/team_library/sharing#sharing-environments). Users might have different environment variable values, so updates to these values are not synced between shared environments.
* **See the activity feed in the Team Library**
  
  You can see changes to shared collections in the [activity feed](/docs/v6/postman/team_library/activity_feed_and_restoring_collections).
* **Subscribe to shared collections**
  
  When you [subscribe to a collection](/docs/v6/postman/team_library/sharing), you get a synced copy of this collection in your Postman app. If you have edit permissions for the collection, you can make changes that other subscribers to the collection can see.
