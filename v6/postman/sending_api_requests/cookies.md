Postman’s native apps provide a **MANAGE COOKIES** modal that lets you edit cookies that are associated with each domain. If you want to capture cookies using Postman Interceptor, refer to the section [Capturing cookies](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/interceptor_extension/).

## Getting to the cookie manager

To open the **MANAGE COOKIES** modal, click the **Cookies** link under the **Send** button.

This opens the **MANAGE COOKIES** modal, and displays a list of domains and the cookies associated with them.

## Create a cookie

To add a new cookie for the domain, click on the **Add Cookie** button. A pre-generated cookie string according to the [HTTP State Management standards](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1) will be created, but you can edit it using the text input that appears below it. Clicking the **Save** button will save it to the app’s cookie store under the relevant domain.

## Adding a domain

If you want to add a cookie for a domain that isn’t present in the domain list, you can add one by entering the hostname (without the port or the `http://`) in the input box at the top. Clicking the **Add** button will add it to the domain list. You can then add cookies for this domain by selecting it, and entering a new cookie value as described above.

## Updating a cookie

To update an existing cookie, go to the domain from the domain list, and click the cookie you want to edit. You can edit any property, and hit **Save** to update.

### Adding Cookies through Set-Cookie header

You can also add/edit the cookies through the [Set-Cookie header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) through the response.  

## Whitelisting domains for programmatic access of cookies

To whitelist a domain so that cookies can be programmatically accessed, click the **Cookies** link under the **Send** button and open the **MANAGE COOKIES** modal. Click on **Whitelist Domains** from bottom left and enter the list of
domains needed to be whitelisted.

## Programmatic accees of cookies

Postman also allows for programmatic cookie access i.e. creating and manipulating cookies by special methods instead of relying on the graphical interface, granting a greater degree of control over cookies to the users.

The very first step to perform any kind of operation on cookies is to create a **Cookie Jar**, an object that will contain the
cookies and the methods that will be used to operate on cookies.

## Creating a Cookie Jar

To create a "cookie jar", use the `pm.cookies.jar()` method. This will create an object containing the cookies and the methods that would be needed to access them.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();`

## Creating a cookie

After a cookie jar is created, we can place cookies into it by the following methods:

1. Set a cookie using the `.set()` function, it takes a URL, a cookie name and a cookie value.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();` // create a cookie jar

`cookieJar.set(URL, cookie name, cookie value, callback(error, cookie));` // create a cookie

1. One can also set a PostmanCookie or its compatible cookie object using the `.set()` function.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();` // create a cookie jar

`cookieJar.set(URL, { name: cookie name, value: cookie value, httpOnly: true }, callback (error, cookie));` // create a PostmanCookie

## Get a cookie

To retrieve a cookie, `.get()` function is used. The function takes a URL and name of the required cookie. It returns the value of cookie.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();` // create a cookie jar

`cookieJar.set(URL, cookie name, cookie value, callback(error, cookie));` // create a cookie

`cookieJar.get(URL, cookie name, callback(error, cookie));` // get the created cookie

## Get all the cookies

To get all the cookies for a particular URL that are in the cookie jar, `.getAll()` function is used, it takes a URL and returns all the cookies for that URL.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();` // create the cookie jar

`cookieJar.set(URL,first cookie name,first cookie value, callback(error, cookie));` // create one cookie

`cookieJar.set(URL,second cookie name,second cookie value, callback(error, cookie));` // create another cookie

`cookieJar.getAll(URL, callback(error, cookies));` // get the created cookies

## Delete a cookie

To delete a cookie, `.unset()` function is used. It takes a URL and the name of the cookie to be removed.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();` // create the cookie jar

`cookieJar.set(URL, cookie name, cookie value, callback(error, cookie));` // create a cookie

`cookieJar.unset(URL , cookie name, callback (error));` // Delete the created cookie

## Delete all the cookies

To clear all the cookies for a URL, `.clear()` is used. It takes the URL for which all the cookies are to be removed. Note that `.clear()` removes all cookies for a particular URL, it DOES NOT remove all the cookies in the jar as there may be cookies for more than one URL in the cookie jar.

`const cookieJar = pm.cookies.jar();` // create cookie jar

`cookieJar.set(URL,first cookie name,first cookie value, callback(error, cookie));`  // set one cookie

`cookieJar.set(URL,second cookie name,second cookie value, callback(error, cookie));` // set another cookie

`cookieJar.clear(URL, callback (error));` // delete the set cookies

## Properties not yet supported

These are two properties that are not yet supported Postman.

* SameSite
* Cookie Prefixes
        *   __Secure-
        *   __Host-

Whenever you add a domain, Postman will sync all cookies for that domain from the browser. Entering “facebook.com”, for example will sync cookies for facebook and all its subdomains (m.facebook.com). The Interceptor integration keeps cookies for a fixed set of domains in sync from the browser to Postman (cookie updates from the browser sync to Postman, not vice versa). This will let you use any authentication sessions in your browser to make API calls in Postman. However, you will not be able to save them to Postman’s history.

Subsequent updates (on the cookie’s value or other properties) and deletions will be synced as well. Click ‘x’ next to the domain to remove it from the synced set. This will only prevent future cookie updates from being synced - it won’t delete the cookies that have already been synced to Postman.
