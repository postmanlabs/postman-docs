When you create a new Workspace, you must determine whether it is a personal or team workspace.

Postman account users can create an unlimited number of personal workspaces. Users who don't have a Postman account can have only one personal workspace. Postman Pro and Enterprise teams have one default team workspace and can create an unlimited number of workspaces.

### How to create a new workspace

Click any workspace that displays in the header bar. For example, in the image below, you'd click "My Workspace". Click "Personal" or "Team" and then click "Create New".

If you select "Personal", enter the name and description of the workspace. If you decide instead to create a team workspace, select "Team" in the Type menu. Click the **Create Workspace** button to see or add existing collections, or [create a collection](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections){:target="_blank"}.
