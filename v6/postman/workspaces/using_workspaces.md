### Removing elements from workspaces

When you remove a workspace, it is no longer visible in that particular workspace. The element is still available in any other workspace where it exists.

**In the sidebar**

In the Postman app, select a collection and click the ellipses **(...)** button.

Click "Remove from Workspace". The collection is no longer visible in the workspace.
