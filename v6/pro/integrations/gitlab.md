Back up and synchronize your Postman Collections on GitLab (an open source Git repository manager) and on any of your custom domains. Your Collections are all tucked in safe and sound with our latest Postman Pro to GitLab Integration.

Setting up a GitLab integration requires you to get a GitLab Personal Access Token and configure how you would like to back up your collections.

## Generating a GitLab Personal Access Token

Log in to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

If you don’t already have a Personal Access Token from GitLab, [generate a new one](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens).  

Save the generated token to use later.

## Configuring a backup for Postman Collections in GitLab

1. In the [Integrations page](https://go.postman.co/workspaces), find GitLab from Postman's list of 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro/Enterprise.

    The above screen provides you the following two options:

    * [Backup your Postman Collections to GitLab](#backup-your-postman-collections-to-GitLab)
    * [Backup your Postman Collections to GitLab on a custom domain](#backup-your-postman-collections-to-gitlab-on-a-custom-domain)

## Backup your Postman Collections to GitLab

1. Click the **Add Integration** button to enter your Gitlab token to start the integration.

    [![gitlab add](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/GitLab_Add1.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/GitLab_Add1.png)

1. Click the **Add Integration** button.
Your Collection is pushed to your GitLab project under the filename that you specified and saved as a single JSON file.

    Now every change that is saved to your Postman Collection automatically commits changes to your GitLab project in real time. Your Collections and code can exist in the same repository.
