**(New title: Sharing collections in Workspaces for version 5)**


In versions 5.5 and below, teams work collaboratively in a [Team Library](/docs/postman/team_library/setting_up_team_library){:target="_blank"}. 
In a Team Library, you can share collections, environmental templates, view team updates, and subscribe to shared collections. 
However, [Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/intro_to_workspaces){:target="_blank"}, available in Postman version 6.0, 
provides greater visibility and easier access to shared collections. 

In Workspaces you can [organize the collections](/docs/postman/team_library/setting_up_team_library){:target="_blank"} for 
those two projects in separate Workspaces. In each Workspace you can [add or create collections], 
and invite others to collaborate. Members of those Workspaces can see when others add or change it. In addition a collection can exist in other Workspaces at the same time. Any changes to these Workspace collections are visible everywhere they reside.

If you're a Postman Pro user and all the members of your team upgrade to version 6.0, and you haven't, how would your team 
members access the collection? Fortunately Postman provides a workaround for you. 

#### Workaround

When all members of a team are not using Workspaces, all shared collections from a Team Library and Workspaces appear on a page that everyone on the team can see. 

You or another team member can click the **Share** button next to the Team Library collection and add it to a Workspace.

Although this workaround is helpful, it's better to upgrade to Postman version 6.0 so the entire team can automatically 
be in sync without this additional step.
