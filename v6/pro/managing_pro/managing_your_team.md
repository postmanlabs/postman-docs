Postman's web [dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"} provides a number of ways to manage your team.

### Member roles 

Everyone in your team is a **member**. Each member has certain **roles**, which let them perform sets of actions.

Postman supports 3 member roles:

| Roles in Postman |   Permitted actions  |
| ---   |   ---     |
| **Admin**   |    Send out team invites  <br>  Update team member roles  <br>  Remove users from the team |
| **Billing**   |   View payments  <br>  Retry failed payments  <br>  View invoices  <br>  Update card details  <br>  Change billing email  <br>  Cancel and update the team's plan  |
| **User**   |    Use Postman Pro  <br>  Collaborate on collections  <br>  Publish documentation  <br>  Set up monitors for collections  <br>  Use the Postman API  |

Teams are only charged for user roles. If you team size is 10, you can have up to 10 members with the user role. Any of these 10 members can have admin or billing roles as well. Each team can have up to 2 support accounts (only have admin or billing rights, and are not paid for).

By default, members who set up the team for themselves will be granted all three roles. If you're purchasing Postman Pro for someone else, you'll receive an invite to join the team with a billing role.

### Managing roles

An admin can modify the roles of other team members in the [Team page]({{site.pm.gs}}/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"}.

When an admin clicks the **Manage Roles** button, a list of team members appears. The admin selects a user and clicks the button for the role. In the image below, the admin would click the "Billing" button to assign that role to the user. Then the admin clicks the **Done** button at the top of the page to complete the process.

Keep in mind a few restrictions:

   1.  Each team can have up to 2 support accounts (only have admin or billing rights, and are not paid for)
   2.  Each member must have at least one role
   3.  You cannot assign the user role to more members than your team has paid for

### Invites

An invite is an invitation you send to people you want to add to a team. Only admins can manage invites.

**For the user role:** To invite people to join the team with a user role, head to the [teams page]({{site.pm.gs}}/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"}, and click on "Invite Users". Enter the email addresses of those you wish to invite, and hit "Send Invite(s)".

These invites will be visible at the bottom of the member listing. If you don't have any paid slots left, you'll need to click "Add Users" and increase the team size before sending invites.

**For admin or billing roles:** To invite people to join the team with an admin or billing role, head to the [teams page]({{site.pm.gs}}/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"}, click the Settings icon, and select "Add Support Account". Enter the recipient's email address, choose which roles to assign, and hit "Send Invite(s)". These invites will be visible at the bottom of the member listing.

**Canceling Invites:** If you'd like to revoke an invite you've already sent, hit the "X" link next to each invite in the listing on the [teams page]({{site.pm.gs}}/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"}. You can see how many available invites remain in the count displayed on the "Invite Users" button. The available invites will increase by 1 for every canceled invite for the user role.

### Changing team size

**For billing members**: If you're out of paid slots and need to invite more users, you'll need to click "Add Users" on the [teams page]({{site.pm.gs}}/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"}. You'll need to have a saved card to add users. Annual teams will be billed a pro-rated amount for the number of days left in the billing cycle.
