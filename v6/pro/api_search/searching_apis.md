API search, available only for Postman Pro and Enterprise users, lets you search across collections, folders, requests, and responses. This improved search returns a richer set of results because it searches through all of your Postman data.

Currently you only can access this feature in the Postman Dashboard. If you search from within the app, you'll get results from your local app, which may not be synced to all of your Postman data, if you are not signed into Postman.  

To use the new search:

1. Go to the [Postman website](https://www.getpostman.com).

1. Click the **Dashboard** button. You’ll see the search bar at the top of the page. You must be signed in to your Postman account to see the **Dashboard** button.

After you enter your search term, you’ll notice the variety of results that display. For example, in the image below you see search results that include folders and requests.

**Note**: Postman’s search results can sometimes lag behind the changes made to collections, folders, and requests. If you make a change in the app to an element, such as a collection, you might not see that change appear immediately in your search results. Wait a few minutes for the change to be reflected in search results.
