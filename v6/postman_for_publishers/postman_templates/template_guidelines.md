## Why adhere to guidelines?

If you are authoring collections that can be consumed by public, you can publish them to Postman's templates and users can import them and then “Run in Postman”. Postman facilitates a way for you to share your collections with the community by way of its templates. One way is to share the collection as a template. Community-contributed templates might teach someone how to use an API, automate a tedious task, or just use public APIs to do something fun. These collections could be anything - a bunch of useful APIs or a way to automate a workflow. The idea is to allow you to share your collections documentation in different ways if you’re an author of a Postman collection.

### Template format guidelines

To ensure your collections have a wider adoption, your collection documentation should adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Template name

Your template documentation must have an appropriate name.

### 2. Introduction

Provide a proper introduction to your collection. Your collection may not find adoption without necessary information about the collection details. These details provide a sense of direction to the user. The above screen illustrates an example of a good introduction.

### 3. Steps to quickly get started

Provide useful information about your collection and other prerequisites to jump-start your users to using the collection. Talk about the APIs used and how to authenticate them, if necessary. If you've used environments, then talk about them in detail. The following screen illustrates a very good example of a quick-start.

### 4. Endpoints and params

Be a bit magnanimous in describing your collection details. If possible, clearly document the resource descriptions, endpoints and methods, parameters, sample requests, sample responses and schemas. The following screens illustrate a clear description of endpoints and parameters.
