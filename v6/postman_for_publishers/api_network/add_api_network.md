The [**Postman API Network**](https://explore.postman.com/) has amassed the widest variety of public APIs for your browsing pleasure. Verified publishers are required to submit their complete Postman collections for review. Community contributors can also share their own solutions and projects as [templates](/docs/postman_for_publishers/postman_templates/add_templates/) to help the broader community.

For API publishers, the Postman API Network is an easy way to introduce your API to millions of developers worldwide. You can publish your collections as an interactive API reference along with any workflows to help users get onboarded quickly and effectively. Gather metrics about how many people are using your APIs and insights about how they are being used to refine your next generation of APIs.

For API users, you're probably wondering if there's an API out there for your specific use case. Whether it's finding sushi restaurants near you or integrating your CI/CD pipeline with your enterprise messenger, the API Network can help with that. Browse the network, and when you find what you're looking for, import the collection with a simple click of the [Run in Postman button](/docs/postman_for_publishers/run_button/creating_run_button). Within moments, you'll be interacting with the API in Postman.

### How to add APIs to the API Network

For API publishers, you can add your API to the API Network when [publishing your collection](/docs/postman/api_documentation/publishing_public_docs), or while editing your Collection Discovery details. Ensure your API has an API name, summary, and description.

Select the categories that best describe your API and service. Once submitted, the Postman team will review the submission for approval before your API is accessible to millions of developers worldwide.
