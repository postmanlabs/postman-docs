By default, Postman Monitors access APIs from dynamic IP addresses. For Enterprise users who want to test APIs behind a whitelist restricted firewall, Postman provides the option to monitor APIs from a static IP address.

By whitelisting a single static IP address, customers can monitor their APIs using Postman’s monitoring service, while conforming to company security policies.

Enterprise users can request the static IP option from our [Enterprise support team](http://pages.getpostman.com/Enterprise-Sales_Contact-Us.html).  Note that monitoring APIs using a static IP address is available for all Postman Enterprise customers. However, the static IP is a US address.

When the static IP option is enabled, Enterprise users can create a new monitor or change an existing monitor to run using a static IP address.

## Creating a new monitor to run from a static IP address

In the Postman app, click the "Build" dropdown menu and select "Browse".

Choose the collection you want to monitor, click the ellipsis **(...)** icon, and select "Monitor Collection".

In the **MONITOR COLLECTION** modal, [enter the name and select the environment of the monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor/).  

In "Regions", select "US (Static IP)" to monitor the collection from a static IP address. You can also [specify a monitor to run in one or more regions](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor/).

Click the **Monitor this collection** button to complete the process.
