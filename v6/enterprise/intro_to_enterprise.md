Postman helps Enterprise users build a fast, smooth API development workflow that monitors the health and status of APIs, produces quality documentation, connects to third party tools to enhance the API development workflow, and implements an agile process to test APIs.

Postman provides Enterprise users with:

* Single Sign-On (SSO): Access to the the company’s Postman instance by using the customer’s existing identity management solution. Postman Enterprise currently supports multiple SSO providers – Okta, OneLogin, Duo, Ping Identity, AD FS, and GSuite. Postman provides SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider support. 

* Audit logs: Ability to track activities within teams, particularly when collaborating on code. With Audit Logs, Postman Enterprise users can review every change, see who made it and when it was made in a user-friendly dashboard. 

* Extended support and billing: Dedicated support, onboarding and billing options for larger organizations with more structured policies around procurement, provisioning and ongoing customer success

In addition to SSO, audit logs, and extended support and billing, the Enterprise plan shares Postman Pro features, such as:

* Team [collaboration](/docs/v6/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} for the single source of truth about your API.  

* API [documentation](/docs/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation){:target="_blank"} to share public or private documentation in a web page.

* [Mock servers](/docs/postman/mock_servers){:target="_blank"} to simulate the real API and decouple teams collection [monitoring](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors) to check the performance of your API.
