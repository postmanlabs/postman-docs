After a team admin has enabled single sign-on (**SSO**) for Postman, users can log in to Postman with a configured Identity provider in two ways:

1. Ask the team admin for the **Login URL** that was generated during the SSO configuration. The **Login URL** automatically redirects the user to the configured Identity Provider.

1. Log in from the Postman app or Postman dashboard and perform these actions:

    * Click "Enterprise user? Sign in here".

    * Enter the team domain to continue.

Postman redirects the user to the configured Identity Provider. Here, for example, the **G-Suite** Login screen.
