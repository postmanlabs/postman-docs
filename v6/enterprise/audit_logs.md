Audit logs is an Enterprise-only feature that lists important team events. An admin can review audit logs to determine:

* When users were added to the team.
* When users received an invitation to a team. 
* Which user performed a specific action.

Audit logs currently include events for team management, billing, and security. In the future, we'll enable events for publishing documentation, creating API keys, and creating monitors.

### Using audit logs
