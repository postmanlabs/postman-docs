Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace that is available for all Microsoft Office 365 users. This integration allows you to get updates about what is happening in your team directly in Microsoft Teams.

Currently, we have two ways in which this integration can be configured.

### Configuring Microsoft Teams


1. In the [Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"} page, find Microsoft Teams from a list of Postmanâ€™s 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

  <li>Click the <b>Add Integration</b> button to see your monitors in the "Configured Integrations" view. You can also click the "Advanced Options" link to indicate if you want notifications when all monitor runs are completed, or if you want notifications for three monitor run failures and then the first successful monitor run.</li>
</ol>

### Get the Microsoft Teams webhook URL

Log in to your Microsoft Teams account. Create a new channel, or go to an already existing channel, where you want to set up this integration.

[![select channel](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031183.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031183.png)

Click on the `...` on the right side of the channel name and select `Connectors` from the dropdown list.

[![select connectors](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031299.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031299.png)

Select the `Incoming Webhook` connector from the list of available connectors.

[![select incoming webhook](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031428.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031428.png)

Enter a name to identify this webhook later. You can also add an image which will be visible whenever a message is posted using this webhook. Click `Create`.

[![enter a name](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031665.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59031665.png)

This will generate a webhook URL which can then be used to post messages to this channel. Copy this webhook and save it for later.
