You can use the Postman Pro to APIMatic Integration to back up your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint and other API Description formats. 

APIMatic Integration converts your Postman Collections to any major API description format and saves them to GitHub.  API Transformer uses a GitHub repository to save its documentation.  

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.


### Configuring APIMatic Integration

1. In the [Integrations page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"}, select APIMatic from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.
