You can use the Postman Pro to APIMATIC Integration to back up your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, and other API Description formats. <br>

This integration allows APIMATIC to convert your Postman Collections into any major API description format, and save the resulting file into your designated GitHub repository. <br> 

If you don't already have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}, you'll need to create one.


### Configuring APIMATIC Integration

1. In the [Integrations page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"}, find APIMATIC in the list of Postman’s 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.
