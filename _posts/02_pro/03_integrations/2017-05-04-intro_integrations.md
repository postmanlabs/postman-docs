Postman provides a strong API development toolchain that integrates seamlessly with the developer's workflow. 

Postman has always supported an open ecosystem. We work with industry leaders to introduce new features and integrations to help their users move painlessly through API development and improve their productivity.

### What is an integration anyway?

Organizations use the term "integration" inclusively, sometimes overly so. Different teams in the same organization might even use the term in different ways as well. Those who work with APIs are already familiar with the idea of bridging communications from one entity to another.

In this case, "integrations" is a way to share data or functionality between Postman and other tools that you might rely on for API development.  When manually importing and exporting data from one application to another becomes a chore, an integration can help.

For example, suppose you use GitHub for your repository management. You also use Postman to develop and test your APIs.  If only there was a way to easily save your Postman Collections to a GitHub repo.  Well, now you can – with the Postman to GitHub integration!
