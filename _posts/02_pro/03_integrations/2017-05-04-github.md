Backup and synchronize your Postman Collections on GitHub, the largest host of source code in the world. Your Collections are all tucked in safe and sound with our latest Postman Pro to GitHub Integration.

### Configuring GitHub Integration

1. In the **[Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"}** page, select Github from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

You also can click the **Configured Integrations** tab to set up other integrations, view available integrations for Github, or view all integrations.
