HipChat is an instant messaging app built for businesses. The team chat tool lets you share files and discuss tasks in real-time with colleagues, project collaborators and even clients through unlimited chatrooms. 

This integration allows you to get real-time updates of what is happening in your Postman team.

You can configure HipChat with Postman to monitor results, view a team's activity feed, and use an HipChat Webhook URL.

### Configuring Postman with HipChat

1. In the [Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"} page, select HipChat from a list of Postman’s 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

You also can click the **Configured Integrations** tab to set up other integrations, view available integrations for HipChat, or view all integrations.


#### Add a team activity feed to HipChat

The Team Activity Feed is where you can view all team activity. You can monitor your team's API development and track all the changes. This integration updates you on all changes in HipChat itself, so you don’t have to go back to Postman to see the team activity feed.

To add a team activity feed to HipChat:
1. Click the **Add Integration** button.
2. In the **Team Activity Feed** page, enter your team's activity feed URL, and click the **Add Integration** button.

The **Configured Integrations** page appears with your team's activity feed.

#### Send monitor run results to HipChat

You can set up monitors on your collections which run on the cloud at a scheduled interval. This integration allows you to get notifications about your monitor runs into HipChat.

To send monitor run results to HipChat:
1. Click the **Add Integration** button.
2. In the **Monitor Run Results** page, select the monitor you want to send to HipChat, and enter the notification URL.
3. Click the **Add Integration** button.

You can also configure advanced options to alert you when a monitor run completes, or when three failures occur and the first monitor run completes successfully.

### Viewing updates on HipChat

Monitor run results on HipChat are color-coded based on the result of the monitor run. It shows the basic metrics of the run and also provides a link to go directly to the monitor.

Similarly, the team activity feed integration consists of the links of the changed instance.
