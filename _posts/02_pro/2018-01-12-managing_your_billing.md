Click the links in the list above to learn how to perform other billing management tasks in this page.

### Setting the monitoring block count

In Postman Pro, your team can monitor up to 10,000 requests for free per month. 

Beyond 10,000 requests, you can choose to pay-as-you-go for additional requests, or pre-purchase discounted blocks of monitoring requests.

For pay-as-you-go, your team will be  billed at $0.75 for every 1,000 requests above 10,000 per month. 

Pre-purchased blocks of requests provide a discount, and allow you to set a more predictive billing pattern. Blocks of 500,000 requests are available for a monthly price of $200.

To set the number of monitoring blocks, click the “Set Monitoring Block Count” CTA in your billing overview or usage pages.

To set the monitoring block count: 

* Click the “Set Monitoring Block Count” in the “Your Current Plan” section in the Billing Overview. 
* Select the number of blocks you want to purchase each month. Each block translates to 500,000 requests that can be monitored and costs $200 per month. 
* Click the **Proceed** button. Review the details of your purchase and click the **Pay** button. Your default payment method is charged immediately, and every month on this date.

### Payment Methods

When you click the “Payment Methods” link, you can add your credit card information so Postman can automatically bill your invoices.

For security, Postman does not store any credit card data. This data is stored only by Stripe, our payment provider. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified as PCI Service Provider Level 1—the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.

Your card is automatically charged monthly or annually, depending on your billing cycle. Other charges for your account, such as additional monitoring calls, are charged to this card.

After payment, you’ll see a confirmation with the transaction ID. Use this ID for any communication with Postman.
