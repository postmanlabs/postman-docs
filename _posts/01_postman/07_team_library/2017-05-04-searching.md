### Filtering by name or description

To quickly filter the list of collections in your library, begin typing the collection name or description in the search input field.

### Favoriting

You can favorite collections in the Team Library like you do in the **Collections** sidebar. Click on the star icon to bring the collection(s) to the top of the list. Favorited collections from both places will always be listed at the top.

### Sorting

You can re-order collections in the Team Library by Name, Last Modified, Owner, or by Date Created. Remember that collections that you have favorited will be at the top but now sorted by the criteria you selected.

### Searching through the Slack Bot

You can integrate the Postman Pro Search Slack bot and get more detailed search results too. This feature will be available in the Team Library soon.
