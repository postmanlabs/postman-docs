This topic explains each component of a request in Postman and describes all the ways you can create a request.


## The anatomy of a request

A Postman request consists of these components:

* Request builder
* URL
* Headers
* Cookies
* Header presets
* Method
* Request body


### Request builder

Under the **Builder** tab, the request builder lets you create any kind of HTTP request quickly. 

The four components of an HTTP request are the URL, method, headers, and the body. Postman gives you tools to work with each component.

[![request builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilder_white.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilder_white.png)

### URL

The URL input field stores previous URLs and displays them in the autocomplete dropdown menu as you enter your URL.

When you click on the **Params** button, the [data editor](/docs/postman/launching_postman/navigating_postman){:target="_blank"} opens for you to enter URL parameters. 

You can individually add key-value pairs, which Postman combines as a query string. If your URL already has parameters, such as when you paste a URL from some other source, Postman automatically splits the URL into pairs.

**Note**: Postman doesn't automatically URL-encode parameters you enter in the URL bar or in the data editor. 
Right click on selected text, and select "EncodeURIComponent" to manually encode the parameter value.

**Note:** Postman automatically adds `http://` to the beginning of the URL if no protocol is specified.

[![url and parameters section](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderUrl.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderUrl.png)

Some API endpoints use path variables. You can work with those in Postman. Here is an example of a URL with a path variable:

```
https://api.library.com/:entity/
```

To edit the path variable, click **Params** to see if it'a already entered as the key. Update the value as needed. For example, `:entity` can be “user” in this specific case. Postman will also give you suggestions to autocomplete the URL.

[![edit path variables](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderPath.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderPath.png)

### Headers

When you click the **Headers** tab it shows the headers key-value editor. You can set any string as the header name. The autocomplete dropdown provides suggestions of common HTTP headers as you type in the fields. 

Values for the “Content-Type” header are also available in an auto-complete dropdown.

[![autocomplete headers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/headers_white.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/headers_white.png)

**Note**: Restricted headers: If you're using the [Postman Chrome app](http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/11/01/goodbye-postman-chrome-app/){:target="_blank"}, some headers are restricted by Chrome and the XMLHttpRequest specification. However, sending restricted headers is simple using the [Interceptor extension](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/interceptor_extension).  

### Cookies

You can use the cookie manager in native apps to edit cookies associated with each domain. To open the modal, click the **Cookies** link under the **Send** button. Learn more about [managing cookies](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/cookies){:target="_blank"}.

[![manage cookies modal](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/cookies_white.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/cookies_white.png)

### Header presets

You can save commonly used headers together in a header preset. 

Under the **Headers** tab, you can add a header preset to your request by selecting "Manage Presets" from the **Presets** dropdown on the right.  

[![preset headers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/headerPreset_white.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/headerPreset_white.png)

### Method

You can use the control dropdown to change the request method. The request body editor area changes depending on whether the method can have a body attached to it or not.

[![url methods](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/methods_white1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/methods_white1.png)

### Request Body

While constructing requests, you will be working with the request body editor a lot. Postman lets you send almost any kind of HTTP request. The body editor is divided into 4 areas and has different controls depending on the body type.

**Note about Headers:** When you are sending requests through the HTTP protocol, your server might expect a Content-Type header. The Content-Type header allows the server to parse the body properly. For form-data and urlencoded body types, Postman automatically attaches the correct Content-Type header so you don't have to set it. The raw mode header is set when you select the formatting type. If you manually use a Content-Type header, that value takes precedence over what Postman sets. Postman does not set any header type for the binary body type.

##### **Form-data**

[![form-data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderForm.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderForm.png)

`multipart/form-data` is the default encoding a web form uses to transfer data. This simulates filling a form on a website, and submitting it. The form-data editor lets you set key-value pairs (using the [data editor](/docs/postman/launching_postman/navigating_postman)) for your data. You can attach files to a key as well. Note: due to restrictions of the HTML 5 spec, files are not stored in history or collections. You will need to select the file again the next time you send the request.

Uploading multiple files each with their own Content-Type is not supported yet.

##### **Urlencoded**

[![urlencoded data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderUrlEncoded.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/requestBuilderUrlEncoded.png)

This encoding is the same as the one used in URL parameters. You just need to enter key-value pairs and Postman will encode the keys and values properly. Note that you cannot upload files through this encoding mode. There might be some confusion between form-data and urlencoded so make sure to check with your API first.

##### **Raw**

[![raw data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/58960775.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/58960775.png)

A raw request can contain anything. Postman doesn’t touch the string entered in the raw editor except replacing [environment variables](/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables). Whatever you put in the text area gets sent with the request. The raw editor lets you set the formatting type along with the correct header that you should send with the raw body. You can set the Content-Type header manually too and this will override the Postman defined setting. Selecting XML/JSON in the editor type enables syntax highlighting for your request body and also sets the Content-Type header.

**Tip: **Selecting text in the editor and pressing **CMD/CTRL + B **can beautify the XML/JSON content automatically.

##### **Binary**

[![binary data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/58960827.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/58960827.png)

Binary data allows you to send things which you can not enter in Postman, for example, image, audio, or video files. You can send text files as well. As mentioned earlier in the form-data section, you would have to reattach a file if you are loading a request through the history or the collection.













You can create and save a request from the:
* Request builder
* **New** button
* Launch screen

### Using the request builder

1. In the request builder, select a method and add the request URL.
2. Click the **Save** button.
3. In the **SAVE REQUEST** modal:
   * Enter a title and description for your request. 
   * Select a collection and save the request in it.
   * Click the **Save** button.

For more information about the request builder, see the **Request builder** section below.

### Using the New Button

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.
