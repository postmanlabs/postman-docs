Postman provides a multi-window and multi-tab interface for you to work on APIs. Postman strives to be clean and flexible to your needs. It gives you as much space as possible for your APIs. Navigating through the interface is easy. See the graphic below to see how everything is organized.

[![general layout](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59046674.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59046674.jpg)

### Sidebar

The Postman sidebar lets you find and manage requests and collections. The sidebar is divided into two main tabs, for **[History](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/history)** and **[Collections](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections)**.

You can drag the right edge to resize the width of the sidebar. You can also minimize the sidebar for smaller screens. You can show or hide the sidebar in the Status bar.

### History tab

The Postman app saves every request that you send in the [History](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/history) tab in the sidebar. 

### Collections tab

This tab creates and manages collections from the **Collections** tab in the sidebar. Learn more about [collections](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections) and how they accelerate the speed of your APIs.

### Header toolbar

[![header toolbar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/insync_postmanAcct.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/insync_postmanAcct.png)

The header toolbar contains these options:
   *   **New** button: Creates requests, collections, environments, documentation, mock servers, and monitors.
    *  **Import** button - Imports Postman collections, environments, WADL, Swagger, RAML, or cURL into Postman using files, links or raw text.
   *   **Runner** button - Opens the [collection runner.](/docs/postman/collection_runs/starting_a_collection_run)
   *   New window icon - Opens a new 'Tab', 'Postman Window' or a 'Runner Window'.
   *   **Builder** and **Team Library** tabs - Switches context between the request builder and team library view.
   *   Interceptor/Proxy icon - Manages proxy or Interceptor settings.
   *   IN SYNC status icon - Updates the status of your Postman account.
   *   Public API Library - Displays the Public API network.

### Builder

Postman gives you a tabbed layout for sending and managing API requests in the builder. The top half is the request builder and the bottom half is the response viewer.  

   *   **Cookies** - You can use the **Cookies** link on the far right beneath the **Save** button to access the **MANAGE COOKIES** modal. This feature lets you manage cookies associated with the request. Learn more about [working with cookies](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/cookies).
   *   **Code** - You can use the **Code** link on the far right beneath the **Save** button to access the **GENERATE CODE SNIPPETS** modal. This feature lets you generate code snippets associated with the request in more than 20 languages.

### Console

Two consoles are available in Postman to see what's going behind the scenes.

   *   Postman console - Contains a running log of HTTP requests and responses. You can log messages from scripts. For example you could log messages in a console.log. This feature is only available in Postman's native apps.
   *   DevTools console - Provides diagnostic information during development. To learn how to access DevTools console logs, see [Debugging and logs](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/debugging_and_logs).

Learn more about [troubleshooting with console logs](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/debugging_and_logs).

### Menu bar

The Postman application menu bar provides access to additional features. Note that there are some key differences between the menu bar for Postman's native apps and Postman's Chrome app.

**Postman native app**: Displays more menu options to access specific Postman features.

### Status bar

The status bar at the bottom of the Postman interface gives you a convenient way to:
* Show or hide the sidebar
* Search in collections, environments, and globals
* Open the Postman [console](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/navigating_postman#console)
* Select either a single or two pane layout
* Open the keyboard [shortcuts](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/navigating_postman#keyboard-shortcuts)
* Get help or provide feedback

When you click the Help & Feedback icon, you can summon a menu that provides access to the latest release notes, [documentation](/docs), [security,](https://www.getpostman.com/security) [support,](https://www.getpostman.com/support) and [social media.](https://twitter.com/postmanclient)

[![help icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/statusbar_helpFeedbackMenu.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/statusbar_helpFeedbackMenu.png)

### Tabs and Windows

Postman lets you use multi-tab and multi-window configurations to work on multiple requests or even multiple collections together and simultaneously.

To open a new tab in Postman press the **+** icon in the builder or use the **CMD/CTRL + T** shortcut. From the menu bar, you can also select "New Tab" from the **File** menu to create a new tab.

By right clicking on a tab name, the menu allows you to duplicate or close tabs.  If any tab has unsaved changes and you are attempting to close the tab, Postman will prompt you to save your changes.

##### **Busy tabs**

Busy tabs ensures you don't lose the request you've been working on, even if it isn't in a collection. When you're on a busy tab and open a new request from the sidebar, it opens the request in a new tab and doesn't replace or interfere with the request in the previous busy tab.

What makes a tab busy? When you work in a tab it becomes busy. For example, receiving a response or making changes that are not yet saved (reflected by an orange dot on the tab) creates a busy tab.

##### **Tab and sidebar behavior**

By default, Postman assumes you want to work on one collection request in one tab. When you open a request from the sidebar, Postman opens a new tab if an existing tab has unsaved changes. If not, the request takes over the current tab. You can always open a request in a new tab. From the sidebar under the **Collections** tab, right click a request and select "Open in New Tab".

##### **Tab menu**
Postman offers several tab actions to help you manage your work.

[![help icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/Tab_menu.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/Tab_menu.png)

To access the **Tab** menu, click the three dots on the right side of a tab. A dropdown appears with options to manage your the tabs.

* Duplicate Current Tab
* Close Current Tab
* Force Close Current Tab
* Close All but Current Tab
* Close All Tabs
* Force Close All Tabs

When you "Force Close Current Tab" or "Force Close All Tabs", the tab(s) close immediately without prompting you to save your work in the tab(s).

When you "Close Current Tab", "Close All but Current Tab", or "Close All Tabs", a dialogue box appears with an option to save your work.

[![help icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/Tab_save4.jpeg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/Tab_save4.jpeg)

##### **Moving requests**

Within the request builder, drag and drop tabs to reorder them as you see fit. Open a new request in a new tab, or in a new Postman window. Open multiple windows using the New Window icon in the header toolbar or the keyboard shortcut.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard usability is a high priority for any development tool. For most developers, keyboard shortcuts are a more efficient input method that requires minimum movement and effort compared to navigating with a cursor. For repetitive or well-frequented tasks, keyboard shortcuts improve speed over the long run.

Postman categories keyboard shortcuts as navigation, manipulation, and global.
* Navigational shortcuts to move around the interface
* Manipulation shortcuts to manipulate the current selection
* Global shortcuts to access from anywhere

##### **Navigational Shortcuts**

Postman designs navigational shortcuts to help you navigate quickly between elements. For example, suppose you want to open and send a series of saved requests without a keyboard shortcut. You would have to select a request in the sidebar with a pointer each time to open it in the tab.

With a keyboard shortcut, such as **CMD/CTRL + ALT + 1**, you can focus the sidebar from wherever you are in interface. You can then navigate to the request you want with the arrow keys. And if you combine the **CMD/CTRL + ALT + 1** shortcut with the **CMD/CTRL + Enter** shortcut, you can send a number of requests in the matter of a few seconds.

##### **Manipulation Shortcuts**

Manipulation shortcuts allow you to quickly work on your current selection and perform actions such as edit, delete and duplicate. You can combine navigational and manipulation shortcuts to create and organize collections in your sidebar easily. You can also use these shortcuts in other list views, such as the data editor.

##### **Global Shortcuts**

You can use global shortcuts to perform actions regardless of the element in focus. Examples of such global actions include Save (**CMD/CTRL + S**), Save As (**CMD/CTRL + Shift + S**), and Send Request (**CMD/CTRL + Enter**)
You can also use global shortcuts to perform user interface actions such as toggling the sidebar (**CMD/CTRL +** ),
Jump to URL (**CMD/CTRL + L**), and Open Console (**CMD/CTRL + ALT + C**).

##### **View keyboard shortcuts for your OS**

Different operating systems will have different shortcuts.  You can always view a complete list of your operating system's shortcuts when you click the **Keyboard Shortcuts** icon in the **Status bar**.

### Data editor

Working with large amounts of data can be cumbersome and time consuming. Postman's data editor lets you view and manipulate data in a fast, effective, and elegant manner. Since most users use spreadsheets to work with data, we leveraged those spreadsheet features to design the data editor to make it a familiar experience.  

##### **Visual layout**

We've configured the available horizontal and vertical space more effectively to optimize the data you can display up front.

On hover, relevant features display for a specific row to reduce clutter in the interface and help you focus on the most relevant data.
