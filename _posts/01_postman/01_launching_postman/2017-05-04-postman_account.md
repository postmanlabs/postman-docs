### Switching multiple accounts

You can sign in to multiple accounts at the same time in the Postman app and the Postman web dashboard. After you sign in, you can switch between these accounts. 

#### How to switch accounts in the Postman app 

When you first open the Postman app, you can sign in as an existing user or create an account. 
If you bypass the initial sign-in option, you can click the **Sign In** button on the top right corner of your screen at any time.
