### Create New  

In **BUILDING BLOCKS**, create a new request, collection, or environment.

In **ADVANCED**, create a new monitor, documentation, and a mock server.

**Note**: At the bottom, you can select “Show this window at launch” to indicate whether you want the **Create New** tab to display each time you open Postman.

**Note**: You can directly create a new feature when you click the down arrow at the right side of the **New** button.

<h4 id="mock_servers">Creating mock servers</h4>
A [mock server](/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock){:target="_blank"} simulates each endpoint in a Postman Collection. You can mock a request and response in Postman before you send the actual request or set up a single endpoint to return the response.

3. Select if you want to mock a new API or an existing or team collection. If you create a new API to mock, you must select a request method and enter the request path, response code, and response body. If you use an existing or team collection to mock, you must select a collection from a list of existing or team collections. 

[![config mock](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/mock-config.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/mock-config.png)

### Template and API Network tabs

<h4 id="templates">Templates</h4>

You can select ‘Templates’ to help you: check links, track Github issues, verify non-MFA access to AWS accounts, monitor the status of URLs, check DNS records, use Postman Echo to test your REST client and make sample API calls, and monitor AWS ElasticBeanstalk environments. 

You can view all the templates, or select to view them in the "Developer" or "DevOps" category.

[![templates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/templates-tab.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/templates-tab.png)

To import a template:

1. Click on the template you want. In this example we're using the "Link Checker" template.

**Note**: Each template has a description that lists the values required to run the template. In this example, the Link Checker template requires a `start_url` and a `root_url`.

[![linkCheckertemplates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/linkchecker-template.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/linkchecker-template.png)

<ol start="2">
  <li>Click the <b>Use this template</b> button to summon the <b>Customization options</b> screen.</li>
</ol>

This screen lists what Postman will create for you with this template and some configuration options available to you. Postman saves the values you enter as environment variables. Make sure you fill all the fields as these values might be crucial for the template to work properly.

<ol start="3">
  <li>To configure your monitor, select how often you want the monitor to run and enter the URL you want to monitor in "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS" section.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Create</b> button.</li>
</ol>

The **Success!** screen displays what Postman created for you and suggests next steps to consider to get the most out of the template.

<ol start="5">
  <li>Click the <b>Okay</b> button to exit the screen.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="API_network">API Network</h4>

The [Postman API Network](https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/){:target="_blank"} provides the most authentic and actionable directory of public APIs available. Every API listed in this network includes a complete Postman collection, created by the API's publisher. Postman specifically designed the API list to onboard developers quickly and effectively.

On the left side of the screen, Postman groups the APIs categories such as Marketing, Financial Services, E-commerce, and so on. You can search these categories to find an API.

After you select an API from the list, you can import it into your collections.

[![API_network](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/apiNetwork-tab.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/apiNetwork-tab.png)

To import an API in the API Network:

1. Click an API in the API Network list. In this example, we're using the Auth0 API.

[![API_networkExample](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/apiNetwork_authO.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/apiNetwork_authO.png)

<ol start="2">
  <li>Click the <b>Run In Postman</b> button to import the the API's collection.</li>
</ol>

You can see the API you imported in the [sidebar.](/docs/postman/launching_postman/navigating_postman#sidebar){:target="_blank"}
