Workspaces is an easy and efficient way to collaborate with a group of users to develop and test APIs. You can either organize your work in personal Workspaces or work with others in team Workspaces. Postman designed a set of features that unleashes the power and versatiltity of using Workspaces.

Here you'll learn how to perform actions on Workspaces and how to use Workspaces to work with Postman elements.

### Adding collections and environments from another Workspace

You can add collections or environments from one Workspace to another personal or team Workspace. 

In the [Workplaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, select a Workspace and click the **Add to workspace** button. The personal Workspaces view appears by default. Click "Team" to add collections or environments to team Workspaces.

[![add to workspaces](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)

In the Add to this Workspace page, select the source Workspace that contains the collection or environment you want to add to the target Workspace. Then click "Collection" or "Environment" and select the element(s) you want.

Click the **Add to this Workspace** button. The element(s) appear in your list of collections or environments in the target Workspace.

### Removing elements from Workspaces

When you remove a Workspace, it is no longer visible in that particular Workspace. The element is still available in any other Workspace where it exists. 

You can remove an element from a Workspace in the Postman app sidebar, or in the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}.

#### Removing collections from a Workspace in the sidebar

In the Postman app, select a collection and click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button.

Click "Remove from Workspace". The collection is no longer visible in the Workspace.

#### Removing elements from a Workspace in the dashboard

In the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, click an element. In this example, we click "Collections".

Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button in the element you want to remove and select "Remove from workspace". The Workspace is no longer visible in the Workspace.

### Deleting Workspaces

When you delete an element, you erase its existence in Postman. 

To delete a Workspace, go to the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"} and select a Workspace. In this example, we select a team Workspace to delete.

Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button for the element you want to delete and select "Delete".

In "Delete Workspace", click the **Delete** button. Remember when you delete a Workspace, it is gone forever!

### Joining Workspaces

A user can join a Workspace to work on collections, environments, monitors, mocks, and integrations. Let's see how.

In the Postman app, click a Workspace in the header bar, which is "Neutrino level dectection" in this example.

Select "Team" and select a Workspace to join under WORKSPACES YOU CAN JOIN.

### Sharing Workspaces

Postman lets you share your personal Workspaces with other users.

In the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, select a personal Workspace you want to share. Next, click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button and select "Share".

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)

Click the **Share this workplace** button.  Your shared Workspace appears in team Workspaces.

### Sharing collections in Workspaces

Postman enables you to share your collections in Workspaces from the Postman app and the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}. 

**Sharing collections in the sidebar**

In the Postman app, select a collection in the sidebar and click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button.

Select "Share Collection". The **SHARE COLLECTION** modal appears. It offers three ways to share a collection: "Share in another workspace", "Embed", and "Get Link".

[![share sidebar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collection-sidebar.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collection-sidebar.png)

**Sharing collections in another Workspace**

Select this option to add a collection to a team Workspace. The collection is visible to the team.

[![share collections](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collections-in+WS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collections-in+WS.png)

**Sharing collections with the Embed or Run In Postman button**

Select this option to embed a **[Run in Postman](/docs/postman_for_publishers/run_button/creating_run_button){:target="_blank"}** button in your collection for your API documentation, website, or Github readme. 

The **Run in Postman** button lets anyone import and run this collection with one click. When you click the **Generate Code** button, you get a link that you can use for a dynamic or static button. You can also select the environment you want for the generated code.

The **Run in Postman** button shares the collection directly from Postman, so the collection is uploaded to Postman servers when you generate the embed code
