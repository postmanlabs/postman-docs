You can manage personal and team Workspaces, and the Postman elements (collections, monitors, documentation, mocks, environments, and integrations) associated with a Workspace. You can perform such tasks as editing names and descriptions, viewing details, or creating elements for Workspaces.

In the Postman app, click any Workspace that displays in the header bar. In the image below, it's "Team Workspace".

Click "Manage" to display the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"} in your web browser.

### Managing personal Workspaces

By default, the personal Workspaces view appears. 

[![add to workspaces](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)

In this view, click the **Add to workspace** button to [add collections or environments from another Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} to the selected Workspace. You can also perform this action in the team Workspace view.

Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button to:

* [Share personal Workspaces with other users](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [View details about personal Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Rename personal Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Edit descriptions of personal Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Delete personal Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

You can also click the **Create a new workplace** button to [create a new personal or team Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.


### Managing team Workspaces

In the team Workspaces view, click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button to:

* [View details about team Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Rename team Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Edit descriptions of team Workspaces](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

### Managing Workspace elements

When you click a personal or team Workspace, you can see all the elements and activity of that Workspace.  

If you click the **Share** button, you can [share this collection](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} with another Workspace. 

If you click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button, you can [remove any element](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} from the Workspace, and [publish](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} collections.

[![workspace elements](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-or-removepWS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-or-removepWS.png)

Let's explore how to manage Workspace elements.

**Collections**

[Add collections to this Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} or [create collections](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} in the Postman app. Collections is the default view.

**Environments**

Add environments to this Workspace or [create environments](/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments){:target="_blank"} in the Postman app. After you add environments, you can share them with other Workspaces.

**Monitors**

[Create monitors](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor){:target="_blank"} to track the performance of collections in a Workspace. You can wait to see performanance results at the scheduled run time, or click the **Run** button to see performance results now.

**Mocks**

[Create a mock server](/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock){:target="_blank"} to simulate each endpoint and its corresponding environment in a collection, before sending the actual request. Postman redirects you to the app to create the mock server.

**Integrations**

View a list of current integrations or create Workspace integrations. If you create an integration, Postman provides a list of [third party integration apps](/docs/pro/integrations/intro_integrations){:target="_blank"} to help you create the type of integration you want.
