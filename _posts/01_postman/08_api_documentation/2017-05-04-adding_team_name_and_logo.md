Postman users with the **Admin** member role can add a team name and logo to their Postman team account directly from the [Edit Team Details page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams/edit).

### Update your team name

You can see your current team name on the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) of the Postman web view.

If you didn’t enter a team name when you first created your Postman Pro or Enterprise team, you can update that now. From the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams), select Team Settings in the Team tab.

### Update your team logo

From the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams), click the gear icon in the top right, and select “Edit team” to add or update your team logo.

This uploaded image will be displayed in the header of your team's [published documentation](/docs/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation) instead of the Postman logo. It may take up to 5 minutes for the logo to update.
