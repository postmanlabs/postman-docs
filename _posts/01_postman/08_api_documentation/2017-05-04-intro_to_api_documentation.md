Postman's API documentation feature lets you share public or private API documentation in a beautifully formated web page. 

Postman generates and hosts browser-based API documentation for your collections automatically in real-time. Each collection has a private and public documentation view that Postman generates from synced data in the servers. 

To [access the private view](/docs/postman/api_documentation/viewing_documentation){:target="_blank"} that's available to your team, click "View in web" in the Postman app or in the "Team Library". 

When you [publish your documentation](/docs/postman/api_documentation/publishing_public_docs){:target="_blank"}, you can use the public link to view the documentation. The public link displays after you publish your documentation. The documentation is also accessible in the "Published" dropdown in the private documentation view.

* **New** button

### What gets automatically generated?

Documentation for your API includes:

   *   Sample requests, headers, and other metadata
   *   Descriptions associated with requests, folders, and collections
   *   Generated code snippets in some of the most popular programming languages

Postman uses ordered requests and folders to organize documentation in sections to reflect the structure of your collection.

You can customize descriptions using [Markdown](/docs/postman/api_documentation/how_to_document_using_markdown){:target="_blank"} styling with embedded graphics to complement your documentation. 

We support GitHub flavored markdown so you can include tables. When including block elements, make sure you leave an empty line before and after to avoid any rendering issues.

### Free documentation views with your Postman account

Your Postman account gives you a limited number of free documentation views per month. You can check your usage limits through the [Postman Pro API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com){:target="_blank"} or the [account usage page](https://go.pstmn.io/postman-account-limits){:target="_blank"}.
